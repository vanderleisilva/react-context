This project contains a global state management implementation using react context and hooks

## React Context

The idea here is to showcase a basic todo list implementation having a central state with the same concepts of the redux architectural implementation but using only react.

### `live implementation`

[Check here](https://vanderleisilva.github.io/react-context/) the project live implementation. The project contains a basic todo list and the application current global state, then you can play around and check the updates done on it.

### `further reading`

[Check here](https://dev.to/vanderleisilva/global-state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-5f6h) the article about the project elaboration, decisions made, reasons and further considerations.
